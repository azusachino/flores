黑洞是万事万物的终点。

> [!info] Black Hole
A **black hole** is a region of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime") where [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation") is so strong that nothing – no [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle "Particle") or even [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") such as [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light "Light") – can escape from it. The theory of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") predicts that a sufficiently compact [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass "Mass") can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The [boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(topology) "Boundary (topology)") of no escape is called the [event horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon "Event horizon"). Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal [black body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body "Black body"), as it reflects no light. Moreover, [quantum field theory in curved spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory_in_curved_spacetime "Quantum field theory in curved spacetime") predicts that event horizons emit [Hawking radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation "Hawking radiation"), with [the same spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation "Thermal radiation") as a black body of a [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature) inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a [kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin "Kelvin") for [stellar black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_black_hole "Stellar black hole"), making it essentially impossible to observe directly.
