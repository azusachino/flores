## How Do We Process Information?

## What is CLT?

`Cognitive load` relates to the amount of information that working memory can hold at one time.

Since working memory has a limited capacity, instructional methods should avoid overloading it with additional activities that don't directly contribute to learning.

## Cognitive Load Theory in the Classroom

- Measure expertise and adapt presentation accordingly - What seems obvious to you may not be at all obvious to them
- Reduce the problem space - the working memory overloading problem
- Reduce split-attention effect - difficult to create new schemas
- Take advantage of auditory and visual channels in work memory
