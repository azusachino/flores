**THE DESIRE TO KILL TIME IS ROOTED IN NIHILISM**

## Wikipedia

- Rejects generally accepted or fundamental aspects of human existence
  - objective truth
  - knowledge
  - morality
  - values
  - meaning
- Different nihilist positions hold variously that human values are baseless
  - life is meaningless
  - knowledge is impossible
  - some set of entities do not exist or are meaningless or pointless

## Some Thoughts

- Our life is meaningless, so why work hard to pursuing things that will be gone for sure. Instead of any endeavor, it is much easier to kill time with the help of current high-tech; and the society is helping human to live an easier life, right?
- And, for most circumstances, hard work will not pay off, it is impossible to break the `tier` between. You born poor, have less chance to learn things, maybe never know what the world (outside) looks like; or just live with your powerlessness, wait for the day ends come.
