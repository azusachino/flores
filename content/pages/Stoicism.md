## Wikipedia

- It is a philosophy of personal eudaemonic[^1] virtue ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world, asserting that the practice of virtue is both necessary and sufficient to achieve `eudaimonia` - flourishing by means of living an ethical life.

## Other Sources

- 情绪起伏时，坚定不为所动。有哪些情绪反应并没有错，也不失尊严 - 人生来就有情绪。错的是不能像英雄般，或者至少像个有尊严的人那样挺直腰杆。
