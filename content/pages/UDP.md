UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol. Compared to TCP, the UDP network protocol is less reliable, but faster and more straightforward. It's often used in situations where higher speeds are crucial, like in streaming or gaming.

UDP is connectionless, so it doesn't establish a prior connection between two parties. It has the potential to lose data along the way, but in return you'll have much higher speeds.
