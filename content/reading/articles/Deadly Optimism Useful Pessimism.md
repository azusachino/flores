**What's really needed is a realistic sense of what's possible, and a dogged determination to heal division, protect nature and culture, and build sustainable alternatives to our current fossil fuel-based, centralized industrial support systems.**

1. 寻求更带现实意义的解决方案
2. 坚定不移的决心去治愈种族格列问题、保护自然与文化、寻找石油的替代品，以及转移现在的以工业为中心的商业系统。
3. 保护性的消极心态 (Defensive Pessimism)

Most people's brains have soaked for decades in a marinade[^1] of rosy expectation.

## Pervasive Optimism

Since the 1950s, forecasts for the human future could be summarized by the adjectives _more, bigger,_ and _faster_.

This pervasive optimism was based on the actual experience of much of humanity, which saw wonders unfold throughout the 20th century (though a large number of people were not invited to the feast; indeed, their lives, labor, and resources were part of the menu).

Optimism was a self-reinforcing feedback: the system delivered more, people came to expect more, so the system was primed to deliver still more.

20世纪的人们是被动乐观，21世纪的我们马上要变得被动消极了。

20世纪，各项新技术、新事物蓬勃而出，一片欣欣向荣之景；
21世纪，开始偿还年少无知时所欠下的技术债务了，矿产的过度开采、自然环境的肆意破坏、全球变暖，肉眼可见的「悲剧」将越来越多。

人们的生活质量越来越好，生活节奏越来越快；难道幸福度能够一直指数级增长吗？还是说未知的悲剧「巨大落差」已经在路上了。

Indeed, more and more people are resorting to rage, fatalism, nihilism, and escapism precisely because what they are actually experiencing is so incongruent[^2] with the dominant cultural narrative of progress and abundance.

反全球化，发展本地集体，才可能有机会应对即将到来的终结之时。

### 工业革命以来

大势扩张，终将付出代价。

1. 环境污染
2. 全球变暖
3. 资源匮乏
4. 物种灭亡

地球终究只有一个，影响到的将是在场的每一个人。而太多的人对「征兆」视而不见。

## Defensive Pessimism

- Not just have a gloomy outlook
- Have learned to harness negative thinking to improve their coping and adaptive skills through goal orientation
- Think and plan with more care

==The motivating ideal of the defensive pessimist might be stated as "respecting limits and living well within them".==
