- 主要探讨了为什么有些人说一套，做一套。
- 知行合一 **True Belief**  ~~Or is it?~~
- > Where it is difficult to believe a thing, it is often much easier to believe that you ought to believe it.
- Words and actions are mere signals of a belief, but only thoughts reveal true intentions.
- Introspection is about checking yourself in that moment, and revising that misguided route to direct it toward the truth. It's about being committed to drawing your map to the best of your ability, and not in a way that is convenient and reliant upon the expectations of others.
- Question your words, Observe your actions, Have your thoughts
