Envy is one of the great struggles plaguing humanity today and it's only getting worse.

**You will be envious of those that have reached your desired state, but are not too far removed from it. Those that are too far out will be sources of inspiration, not envy.**

## The Envy Guideline

- You once had a shared history with the rival, but now the rival seems to be way ahead of you
- A rival's path to success appears easily replicable
- The rival seems very relatable to you. You have similar interests, similar outlooks, but the outcomes appear to be wildly different

## How to Get Rid of Envy?

- The interplay of three things
  - A desired good
  - A rival
  - A landscape of potential rivals
- Question the desired good
  1. Reframe the (imagined) dynamic you have with your rival
  2. Take time to block all incoming noise from potential rivals. Focus on your own life
