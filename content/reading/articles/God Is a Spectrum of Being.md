**Even if we use the laws of physics to explain the universe, we cannot use them to explain why the universe is organizable into laws in the first place.**

- Belief-in-God is not binary, rather a spectrum
- **If God is nature, then by definition, God couldn't be anything supernatural.**
- The **totality of existence**: the sum total of every individual object and relationship that exists (and has ever existed)

没有必要纠结于无神论和有神论，All by the Nature

> I believe in Spinoza's God, who reveals himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.
