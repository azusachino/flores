Worry is driven by the fear of uncertainty, and being aware of this fear is further acknowledgement that you don't know what will happen next.

**The antidote to worry is not to be passively aware of it, but to take proactive steps to fix it.** 切换思维，正面作战。You must commit to understanding the anatomy[^1] of worry, and then go in like a mechanic to disentangle[^2] what went wrong.

In a non-worrier's mind, they'll shift to problem-solving mode if something can be done, and they'll shift to neglect mode if nothing can. 也就是，能解决的问题，立刻动手去解决；解决不了的，听天由命，不去多想。

Three D's

1. Decide - 遇到问题时，先考虑可做的事情，并给出自己的选择，但不真正去做
2. Do Nothing - 冷静 24 小时
3. Decide Again - 再回顾第一点的选择是否合理，如果是，那就立即执行

## The Worry Replacement

相较于一直在纠结的小问题，当更大的问题袭来之时，如俄乌战争、全球经济衰退等，你就会发现，计较再多都没用；个人的能力是有限的，过好每一天可能才是最重要的。

有时，更大的问题，可以被视作为挑战。**worry is a self-destructive force, while challenge is a self-actualizing one**.

## Takeaway

1. **When a worry arises, notice that there's only one question that matters: "Is there anything I can do about it?"**
2. **If the answer is "Yes, I can do something about it," then put your decision through the Three D's.**
3. **If the answer is "No, I can't do anything about it," then replace the worry with a challenge to direct your attention to something more fruitful.**
