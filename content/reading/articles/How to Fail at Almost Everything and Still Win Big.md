- Do creative work first
  - The way I approach the problem of multiple priorities is by focusing on just one main metric: my energy
  - I make choices that maximize my personal energy because that makes it easier to manage all of the other priorities
  - One of the most important tricks of maximizing your productivity involves matching your mental state to the task
  - 合理利用自己的精力，找到最佳搭配，在最佳的时间做最重要的事情
- On expecting people to be reasonable
  - 世界上的绝大多数人都不是理性的人
  - 不产生那些莫须有的期待，不去争辩
- The most important form of Selfishness
  - _The most important form of selfishness involves spending time on your fitness, eating right, pursuing your career, and still spending quality time with your family and friends._
  - 其实不是自私还是无私的问题，而是优先级的问题
  - 只有个人的生活足够好了，才有时间精力去关注周边的人
- Withholding praise is immoral
  - 不要吝啬「赞美之词」
- Don't read the News for Truth
  - 新闻不是真相
  - 新闻仅适合作为部分「新知识」的渠道
- Fake it till you Make it
  - 光是假装自己开心，就有可能真正变得开心
  - _[W]e are designed to become in reality however we act. We fake it until it becomes real. Our core personality doesn't change, but we quickly adopt the mannerisms and skills associated with our new status and position._
- Change your Mind
  - 不能死脑筋，学会变通
- Systems Trumps Goals
  - _If you do something every day, it's a system. If you're waiting to achieve it someday in the future, it's a goal._
  - _[O]ne should have a system instead of a goal. The system-versus-goals model can be applied to most human endeavours. In the world of dieting, losing twenty pounds is a goal, but eating right is a system. In the exercise realm, running a marathon in under four hours is a goal, but exercising daily is a system. In business, making a million dollars is a goal, but being a serial entrepreneur is a system._
  - _Goal-oriented people exist in a state of continuous pre-success failure at best, and permanent failure at worst if things never work out. Systems people succeed every time they apply their systems, in the sense that they did what they intended to do. The goals people are fighting the feeling of discouragement at each turn. The systems people are feeling good every time they apply their system. That's a big difference in terms of maintaining your personal energy in the right direction. …_
  - 系统更像是，Fake it. 因为我是这样的人，所以保持那样的习惯是理所应当
- Psychology Matters
  - 熟悉心理学
- Consider how you Look
  - 可以从外观上开始，让自己更加「专业」一点
