## Self Compassion

- Being open to and moved by one's own suffering, experiencing feelings of caring and kindness toward oneself
- Taking an understanding, nonjudgmental attitude toward one's inadequacies and failures
- Recognizing that one's experience is part of the common human experience

## Three Closely Connected Components

- Self-Kindness
- Common Humanity
- Mindfulness

Self-esteem is outcomes-oriented, whereas self-compassion is process-oriented.

## Self-Compassion 来之不易

- 需要刻意练习
- 孩童时期就很少受到来自父母的关怀
- 甚至在亲密关系中，总是被拒绝，批评，或者过度保护
- 经常会遭受误解，认为会使人变得自恋、放纵、懒惰
