- If we use salaries as the measurement of progress, it washes away all the color of their experiences and reduces everything to a comparable number.
- The more you peg your work to some standardized metric, the more you use that metric to determine your position amongst others.
- **Anytime progress is standardized, a status game is reinforced**.
- **Mastery is the quest to improve yourself as an end in itself. Comparisons are not made with other people, but only with prior versions of yourself.**
- The evidence of Envy
  - If envy is a recurring problem for you, that means you're always gauging your progress in relation to the advertised positions of others.
  - If you use a metric to gauge what you work on next, then you're allowing the validation of others to dictate your intellectual interests.
  - If you base the quality of your work on its performance – and not how you felt while creating it – then you will never be confident in your own judgment.
