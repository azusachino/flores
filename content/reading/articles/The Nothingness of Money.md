**Money is a required pursuit for life, but a pointless pursuit upon death.**

## 一个问题

富人需要它。穷人拥有它。如果你吃了它，你就会死。当你死的时候，你会带着它一起。它是什么？[^1]

~~Rich people need nothing. Poor people have nothing. If you eat nothing, you die. And when you die, you take nothing with you~~

## 一些想法

- 钱仅仅是一般等价物，不是具有实际价值的物体。
- 换句话说，现代人对于金钱的追求，实际上也就是对社会认同的追求。
- 也就是说，社会反过来放大了「人」对社会的认知和需求。
