Travel is not the cure for the tired mind.

我们从未生活在荒野，却始终有一股「回归」荒野的冲动；不太对。。

生活始终是我们无法摆脱的框架，无论是跌宕还是起伏，最终都会回归到 mundane 的状态。

## The Box of Daily Experiences

But here's the thing about time. No matter where you are, it moves in one direction.

Forward.

And this linear movement of time is nature's way of testing what we have labeled as meaningful. Only time can reveal whether a certain pursuit is driven by fleeting novelty, or if it is motivated by a strong sense of enduring purpose.

**Instead of viewing this box as a problem to escape, we have to realize that it is indeed the only thing that we can truly hold onto.**

接纳自我，接纳生活原本的样子。
